# Time Conversion Task

## The task

OPTION TWO – Time conversion:
A need has been identified for a function that can convert the number of seconds into a
readable time that can be used in category listings on BBC iPlayer to show a rounded up (to
the nearest 5 minutes) duration of a clip or a programme.
The input to the function would be a number and the output needs to be a string of the
number of 5-minute intervals with the word “minutes” on the end.
Example: when passed the input number “442”
the output string is “10 minutes” (as 442 is 7 minutes and 22 seconds – rounded up to 10 minutes).
